# Semester_App

**BIO:**
From the start I wanted to create a fun game/platform that could gather people for a good time. I tried google different old games and etc. to find inspiration. 
Here I found a classic drinking game called "Træmand". Træmand includes a dice and different tasks pr. number on the dice. I want to make a similar game structure, but with adjustments. Which mean for an instance, that there will be different categories and another set-up, so it's not completely the same. 
My plan now is to digitize the game by making an app, which i intuitive and fun to use.
